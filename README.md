# IsomorphicEncoding
By abstracting the ideas of encryption and decryption into two isomorphic functions (as if to say that once composed, form an identity perserving function) a new approach can be taken to encryption. In using functional surity, purity, and obscurity, I hope to provide an encryption method that may confuse many who attempt to solve it (those who are without the key or code).
